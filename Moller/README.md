## Introduction
The file Mollers.ipynb is the *example* file for studying MÃ¸llers in the HPS data and Monte Carlo files based 
on the *minidst* format. Further investigations will likely require subtantial modifications
of this example. These may or may not be checked into this directory as well. 


## Notes:
